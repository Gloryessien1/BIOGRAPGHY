            I am a front-end developer and a social media manager
             based in nasarawa state. 
            This is my first official website.
             I specialize in HTML AND CSS.
             My dream and aspirations has always been to delv
             e into tech and TIIDELab gave me the opportuinity.
             In TIIDELab prefellowship, we were not only taught
             coding. One thing that would forever be in me is the 
             team building and personal branding lectures taught by 
             mr Shams. which i am forever grateful because i will hold 
             head up above my friends. my linked profile was also optimized.
             you can check it out on the home page or on the footer navigation.
            i am ready to use my skills to change the world.
